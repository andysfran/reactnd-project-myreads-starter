# MyReads Project

This project are with Material design, notifications and react router to take care of the routes. For the books, I decided to stay with original CSS given from Udacity. Everything work's fine and we have two pages: The index page shows the books of 3 shelfs(Currently reading, read, want to read) and the search pages, who show a searchbar and you can type any of the categories informed bellow in the "Important" section.

## Run the project

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
